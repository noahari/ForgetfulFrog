GRIDMAP -> 2 ideas for execution: sequence mem vs partial report

Sequence Memory
--------------------
1) Generate Grid**
2) Determine & Display "Holes*" in grid
EX) Determine & Display extra features e.g. hazards, chest, enemies, gems
3) Determine & Display Player location
4) Determine Exit location & Display it
	i) MUST BE REACHABLE FROM PLAYER
5) Fade to black
6) Listen to input until player dies or wins
	i)If player dies, restart them and display their character for a moment


Partial Report
--------------------
1) Generate Grid**
2) Determine & Display "Holes*" in grid
EX) Determine & Display extra features e.g. hazards, chest, enemies, gems
3) Determine & Display Player location
4) Determine Exit location
	i) MUST BE REACHABLE FROM PLAYER
5) Fade to black
6) Display exit location
7) Listen to input until player dies or wins
	i)If player dies, restart them and display their character for a moment


*Holes means a space that if the player moves onto it they are killed, or alternatively they are obstructed from going on

Methods of grid generation
-----------------------------
1) Array based generation, with sts of passable & impassable coords
2) Array based generation, default to holes then generate multiple passable paths and place exit at end of paths
3) Tilesets of NxN size portions of map and create algorithm to tesselate them

Can treat gridmap as DAG/DCG for purposes of placing exit, could even generate a DAG and write something that converts a DAG into a gridmap
